# Changelog

All user-visible changes, important fixes, migrations, and operational notes are
recorded here from `v1.37.35` onward. Older detailed history remains available in
`CLAUDE.md` and Git commit/tag history.

## Unreleased

No changes yet.

## 1.37.36 - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Restored a clean TypeScript build by typing invoice list responses and importing
  MUI's `PaletteMode` from its supported public entry point.
- Corrected the Playwright CAPTCHA locator to match the actual Persian image label.

### Changed

- Production frontend builds now run TypeScript checking before Vite.
- Docker frontend builds use the committed lockfile with `npm ci`.
- E2E tests require an explicit target and refuse production unless the operator
  deliberately enables a read-only production run.
- Added GitHub Actions checks for backend tests, Ruff, frontend type/build, deploy
  script syntax, and Compose configuration.

### Documentation

- Added a staged remediation tracker for the 2026-06-09 whole-codebase audit.
- Added a repeatable release, production deploy, smoke-check, and rollback process.
- Added local-only production operator metadata and Claude commands for batch fixes
  and releases.
- Corrected stale deployment and manual-payment documentation.

### Verification

- Backend: 36 tests passed; Ruff `F` checks passed.
- Frontend: TypeScript and Vite production build passed.
- Playwright: all 6 tests collected with an explicit non-production target.
- Deploy scripts passed `bash -n`; production Compose config validated.

## 1.37.35 - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Treated metering overage tolerance as a threshold: overage at or below the
  tolerance is ignored, while overage above it is billed in full.

### Verification

- Backend tests: 36 passed.
- Frontend Vite production build completed successfully.
- The later whole-codebase audit identified TypeScript and broader typing/lint debt;
  remediation starts with batch B00 in `docs/REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`.
